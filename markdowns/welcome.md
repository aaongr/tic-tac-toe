# Welcome!

This ruby template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using `Ruby`. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/ruby-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

@[Luke, how many stars are there in these galaxies?]({"stubs": ["universe.rb"], "command": "ruby universe_test.rb"})

Check out the markdown file [`welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/ruby-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md) to see how this exercise is injected into the template.

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/ruby-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`ruby-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/ruby-template/tree/master/ruby-project)
A simple `ruby` + `bundler` project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/ruby-template/blob/master/techio.yml)
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal within your contribution. Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
